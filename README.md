## `Project Description`

- ðŸ”­ What is good about Postable **A user can see posts from others, see other users and follow them**
- ðŸ’¬ Other Features **A user can sign in and logout, choose a premium subscription to view all posts .**
- ðŸŒ± State Management **Has been done through context API and useState Hooks, persisted with local storage**
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m happy to have archieved **Mock card payments through Stripe Developer Tools**
- ðŸ’¬ What I learned that is new: **Adding adSense to a Project**
- ðŸ¤” Biggest Challenge I faced **App-wide shared state management without a backend** 

### `Archieving Deliverables`

<div align="left" style="padding: 20px 0 0 20px;">
  <p> Navigating to the application, an anonymous usser will see some posts, 20 to be precise. At the end of the feed, they will then be prompted to sign in. </p>
  <br>
  <p>After signing in, one is then redirected to the home page where they can see all the posts they have written. I have achieved this using react-routing page    navigation.  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Similarly, a signed in user can as well write more posts by clicking the like button. The post object can be seen in the console where it has been logged.  </p>
  <br>
</div>

- The rights of an authenticated user are **They can upgrade to premium, can follow other users and see their posts, can block a single post from their feed**

#### `User Preferences`

<div align="left" style="padding: 20px 0 0 20px;">
  <p> Unfollow: Mock content selection behaviour, When you unfollow a user, you can no longee see their posts in the Following Tab. </p>
  <br>
  <p> Following: After following a user in the Users tab, you can see all their posts by navigating to the Following Tab.  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Like a post: You can like a post once, authenticated or not. See the likes count increase as well.  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Block a post: Once you are signed in, a dislike button is visible. I used this button to act as a block icon, the post is immediately filtered out and state is      persisted so that a user does not see it again  </p>
  <br>
  <p>See your Profile: A navbar has options to navigate to various tabs in the app, including a user profile. Here, you can see your name, number of posts and navigate to the view All page. </p>
  <br>
  <p>You can as well log out from the Navbar by clicking on your icon </p>
  <br>
</div>

As of the time of completion of this project, my Google adSense account had not been fully reviewed to run ads.
